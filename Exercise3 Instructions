You have a box of Christmas gifts that Santa Claus wants to deliver to the children. Each gift is represented by a chain. Santa Claus has a sleigh that can carry a limited weight, and each gift inside the box has a weight that is equal to the number of letters in the name of the gift.

Santa Claus also has a list of reindeers that can help him deliver the presents. Each reindeer has a maximum weight limit that it can carry. The maximum weight limit for each reindeer is equal to twice the number of letters in its name.

Your task is to implement a function distributeGifts(packOfGifts, reindeers) that receives a box of gifts and a list of reindeers and returns the maximum number of boxes of these gifts that Santa Claus can deliver to the children. Gift boxes cannot be split.

const packOfGifts = ["book", "doll", "ball"]
const reindeers = ["dasher", "dancer"]

// the gift boxes weigh 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
// reindeers can carry (2 * 6) + (2 * 6) = 24
// therefore, Santa Claus can deliver 2 boxes of presents

distributeGifts(packOfGifts, reindeers) // 2
Things to keep in mind:

Gift boxes cannot be split.
The names of gifts and reindeers will always be greater than 0.
